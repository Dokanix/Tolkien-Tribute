                    <h2>The Life of the Legend</h2>
                    <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (now Free State Province in South Africa),
                        which was later annexed by the British Empire, to Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, 
                        née Suffield (1870–1904).
                    </p>
                    <p>At the age of 16, Tolkien met Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house
                        where she lived in Duchess Road, Edgbaston. is guardian, Father Morgan, viewed Edith as the reason for Tolkien's having "muffed" his exams
                        and considered it "altogether unfortunate" that his surrogate son was romantically involved with an older, Protestant woman. He prohibited
                        him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with her until he was 21. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter, with one notable
                        early exception, over which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he did not stop.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and the first two volumes of The Lord of the Rings, while living at 20 Northmoor Road in North Oxford (where a blue
                        plaque was placed in 2002). He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name "Nodens", following Sir Mortimer Wheeler's unearthing
                        of a Roman Asclepeion at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, in 1928.
                    </p>
                    <p>During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame.
                        In 1961, his friend C. S. Lewis even nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted 
                        that he had not chosen early retirement. In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a cult-figure, but admitted that "even the nose of a very 
                        modest idol cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!"
                    </p>
                    <p>Edith died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82. Ronald returned to Oxford, where Merton College gave him convenient rooms near the High Street. 
                        He missed Edith, but enjoyed being back in the city. He had the name Lúthien engraved on Edith's tombstone at Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. 
                        When Tolkien died 21 months later on 2 September 1973 from a bleeding ulcer and chest infection, at the age of 81, he was buried in the same grave, 
                        with Beren added to his name.
